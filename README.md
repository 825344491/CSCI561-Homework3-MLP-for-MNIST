# Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch to classify hand-written digits (MNIST Dataset)
 - Implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network with feed-forward & back-propagation algorithms that can be trained to recognize hand-written digits.
 - The neural network was trained with MNIST Dataset and evaluated by both MNIST Dataset and other hand-written test cases created by CSCI-561 TA team.
 - The implementation is totally from scratch using only Numpy and Scipy.
